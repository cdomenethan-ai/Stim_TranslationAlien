Translation Alien
=================

A small futuristic training app built with Tkinter for Windows (and other desktop platforms). Players run through recognition rounds for six-symbol sets, practice typing French words using a custom glyph font, then access a live translator between glyphs and French.

## Features
- Seven rounds of glyph recognition with six-symbol choices and a "none recognized" option.
- Typing practice for French prompts using your own font encoding.
- Live translator panel to convert from glyphs to French and vice‑versa based on your supplied dictionary.
- Neon-inspired styling to feel at home in a sci-fi interface.

## Running the app
1. Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed on Windows (Tkinter ships with the default installer).
2. From the repository root, launch the app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Customizing with your font
- Update `data/recognition_sets.json` with the six-symbol sets you want to display in the first step.
- Add or edit word mappings in `data/lexicon.json`.
  - `practice_words` controls which French prompts appear in the typing phase.
  - `dictionary` maps French words to their glyph string; the reverse lookup is generated automatically.
- Install your custom font on Windows so Tkinter can render it, then change the `family` in `TranslationAlienApp` if desired.

## Notes
- The app stores the JSON data on first launch if the files are missing, so you can freely delete or swap the contents while testing.
- Interface layout is fixed at 720×780 to keep proportions consistent across Windows systems.
